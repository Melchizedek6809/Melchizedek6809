Greetings,

I'm a free software developer from Germany, who mostly codes in Rust/TypeScript/Lisp/C these days, I also do the occasional [Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/melchizedek6809).

You can contact me via the following channels:
- Discord: Melchizedek6809#4065
- Matrix: @melchizedek6809:matrix.org
- E-Mail: ben@wolkenwelten.net (very high-latency due to me checking very infrequently)
